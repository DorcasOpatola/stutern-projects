            <p>My name is <b>Opatola Dorcas Oluwaseun</b>, which means <i>"thanks be to God"</i> in Yoruba language. I am a Chemist, a Virtual assistant and a Tech enthusiast/evangelist. I am currently enrolled in the Stutern Graduate Accelerator(SGA cohort 1.4) course as a software engineer.</p>
            <p>My interest in tech started year end 2018. My school was on one of its incessant strikes then, and I was on campus. My religious organization organised a skills acquisition program and I joined the Python classes. By the end of the two weeks training, I'd built my first ever calculator app. I was beyond thrilled!</p>
            <p>January 2019, I attended my first ever tech conference, organized by <i>Google Developers Group(GDG) LAUTECH chapter</i>. It was there I decided I'm getting into tech fulltime.</p>
            <p>Fast-forward to 2022, November 12th, I attended my first women only tech summit organized by <i>She Code Africa (SCA)</i> in Lagos. I was oppurtuned to be at the live event and <b>IT WAS L.I.T!!!</b> It has further strenghtened my committment to self development and financial stability as a woman.</p>
            <p>I'll stay committed to this path till I start seeing the results I dream of. I'll consistently show up till I start smashing my goal of a six-figure salary.</p>
            <p>You may say, <i>"six-figures?"</i></p>
            <p>I'll say, <i>"why not?"</i></p>
            <p>Where I come from, I see on a daily basis people that really need an helping hand financially. To be the person to give them that second chance at life is one of my deepest passion. Money is meant to be spent (not wasted), better still if its for the good of humanity.</p>
            <p>And as my ALX community mantra says, <b><i>#dohardthings</i></b>. It's not sufficient for me to only work, to solve ordinary problems, no it's not sufficient. I'll go a step further, I'll solve hard problems. Why? because I've been given a privilege. The privilege to be able to reason and have the IQ to go into tech, the privilege of no physical disability, the privelege of a strong support system, the privilege of sound education, the privilege of tech scholarships. I must therefore use my privileges to solve hard problems.</p>
            <p>These are my what, when and why tech, and why <b>I cannot afford to give up.</b></p>

            <p>Let me tell you about my tech journey and my experiences at <b>Stutern</b>.</p>
            <p>I came across the scholarship from <b>I4G</b> via the <b>I4G circle</b> sometime in <i>August/september 2022</i>. At that time I was going through a serious burnout from tech. It was close to the deadline for enrollment I finally made up my mind to register, and give this a try. I thank God I did because, this was exactly what I needed - a small sized community with amazing people that make it difficult for me to hide. lol!</p>
            <p>My <b>software engineering</b> journey at <b>Stutern</b> started with <i>git, GitHub</i> and <i>Ubuntu</i> classes. I had prior knowledge of them so I didn't learn a lot from those classes. One key thing I learnt was how to create a pull request.</p>
            <p>So far, I've learnt the most from the <i>HTML</i> classes. It felt really exhilirating when I deployed my work on <i>Netlify</i> and hosted my first live site. It was WOW! I have deployed two projects successfully on <i>Netlify</i>. I hope to have built a solid portfolio of projects for this first segement of my studies by the time we round it up in December.</p>
            <p>I must also say kudos to our tutors, they make the lessons and classes easy to understand and follow through. They've really boosted my confidence to write my own codes and also critical thinking skills.</p>

            <p>Difference between Paddings, Margins, and borders.</p>
            <p><b><i>Padding</i></b> clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent.</p>
            <p><b><i>Margin</i></b> clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent.</p>
            <p><b><i>Border</i></b> is a line that goes around the padding and content.</p>
